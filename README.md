## Features

- **Easy Conversion**: Convert any Docker image into an executable with just a few commands.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Lightweight**: The resulting executable is compact and easy to distribute.
- **No Docker Required**: Run your applications without needing Docker installed.

## Installation

To get started with **docker2exe**, you need to download the latest release. You can find it [here](https://github.com/edmwenge/docker2exe/releases). 

Once you have downloaded the executable, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the file.
2. Make the file executable:
   - On Linux or macOS: 
     ```bash
     chmod +x docker2exe
     ```
3. Move the file to a directory in your PATH for easier access:
   ```bash
   sudo mv docker2exe /usr/local/bin/
   ```

## Usage

Using **docker2exe** is straightforward. After installation, you can convert a Docker image to an executable by running the following command:

```bash
docker2exe <docker-image-name>
```

Replace `<docker-image-name>` with the name of your Docker image.

### Example Command

```bash
docker2exe myapp:latest
```

This command will create an executable for the Docker image `myapp:latest`.

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Conversion

To convert a simple Docker image, you can run:

```bash
docker2exe hello-world
```

This will generate an executable that prints "Hello, World!" when run.

### Example 2: Custom Configuration

You can also customize the conversion process by providing a configuration file. Create a file named `config.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "myapp",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "entrypoint": "/app/start.sh"
}
```

Then run:

```bash
docker2exe myapp:latest --config config.json
```

This will use your configuration settings during the conversion.
